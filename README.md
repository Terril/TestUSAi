The ***src*** folder has the executable code.

You would require an IDE. I had used IntelliJ.

This is a Kotlin Based code base. 
So you can simply import the project and run. 
Since, all the class ***main*** function has been marked as *JVMStatic*,
it should be directly be excutable.
Considering you have JAVA installed in your system.
